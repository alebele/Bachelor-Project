title: Development of User Interface to Digital Control Programmable Power Supplies

author: Bele Anamaria-Alexandra

description of the project:

This project was thought within the SC HUF ROMANIA SRL company with the main objective of optimizing and
streamlining fundamental functionalities for the test teams.

The main goal was to enable a digital option of controlling the programmable power supply parameters,
which are the voltage and current limit, through a graphical user interface created with the
CANoe tool, thus eliminating the need for manual adjustments of the parameters through the
physical interface of the power supply. 

This digital control provides semi-remote management of the power supply that is connected to the PC or to a remote setup. 
Thus, the engineers can adjust the voltage and current limit of the power supply from distance, when they need to work from home.

This project provides the following features:
- logging: the process through which the voltage and current consumption, along with the simulation
time, are stored in the log file
- reporting: feature that generates a graph showing the changes of voltage and
current values in real-time. It facilitates visual analysis.
- input panel control: this feature allows users to set initial and target values for
voltage, specifying in which way and when the target should be reached. This is helpful in test
scenarios where the power supply needs to adjust its voltage value at a certain time or after a certain
period of time in order to enter a different operational branch.

The project has been successfully configured for two power supplies models: Konstanter and AimTTi.
